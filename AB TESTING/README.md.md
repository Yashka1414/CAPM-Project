\# CAPM Analysis – Apple vs S\&P 500



\## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a practical implementation of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) using real market data.  

The analysis focuses on Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock and compares its performance against the S\&P 500 market index.



The goal of this project is to showcase practical data analysis skills such as data cleaning, merging datasets, return calculation, and basic financial analysis using Python.

\## Key Steps Performed

1\. Loaded and cleaned stock market datasets  

2\. Converted price columns to numeric format  

3\. Merged Apple stock data with S\&P 500 index data  

4\. Calculated daily returns for Apple and the market  

5\. Computed Beta using covariance and variance  

6\. Visualized stock vs market movement
